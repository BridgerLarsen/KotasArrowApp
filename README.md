# Kotas Arrow App

This is my final Capstone Project for Bottega

This app is built with the MERN Stack.
Backend used is express and frontend is react.
This site is a dog breeding site. People can come and look at the site for more information on the company doing breeding as well as view the dogs that are upcoming/currentlty ready to sell. 
You could say it's like a portfolio app for the breeding company as well as each dog.

If anyone is interested in a dog, they can go to the quiestionaire page which you can manually type in the url or get the link in the availablitly page. In this page, you can fill out a google survey to submit.

This app performs all CRUD actions.
